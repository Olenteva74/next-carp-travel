# Carpathians Travel

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The code is divided into separate components.    
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) was used for styling. CSS was used to style background images and pseudo-elements.    
The layout is adaptive and cross-browser - mobile from 320px, tablet from 768px, desktop from 1280px. Use the Mobile first approach.    
[React-scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll) is used for smooth navigation through sections.    
Provided form validation using [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/).    
The infinite slider (on tablet and desktop) is implemented with [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/).
